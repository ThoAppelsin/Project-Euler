**Important warning: Please consider solving the questions for yourself first.**

This is a repository for my solutions to the questions presented at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), in two languages:

- My solutions in C language are from the summer of 2013, just before I have begun studying in Bogazici University. They had been my first exercise in C language.
- My solutions in Python language are from just a couple of days of 2016's summer. I was accompanying a friend to encourage her to studying programming, using a different language this time.

In both versions of the solutions, I was working on not only solving the questions, but limiting myself in computation time, and keeping it under a reasonable limit. This limit was, as far as I remember:

- Approximately a second for C solutions, and I was mostly aiming for less than 100ms.
- Approximately 5-10 seconds for Python solutions.

Most of the solutions are also be implemented in a generic fashion, with the inputs parameterized.
